# MovieSDK
WorkSpace consits of two targets
1.Demo APP 
2.MovieSDK

Steps to build the app.
Clone the source code and run the DemoApp target.
When you run the DemoApp Target first it will run Aggreator for MovieSDK Target and Generate SDK and Place in app folder .

Note: 
USed NSUSerdefaults Instead of KeyChain to store APPKey.
Not able to get exact APIs to fetch all movies list for 2018-2017 in one API . So for Demo Purpose called API only for page 1 .
